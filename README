DESIGN
1. Looping through Board
2. Game duplication with = operator which frees previous memory if necessary before creating a copy of a game. 
3. Game destructor which iterates through the board and frees the memory of all pieces. 
4. Point Value:  we implemented a point value function in each piece.h with its respected value which is later called in the game as a feature of the board at a specific position. This way the point value function in the game.cpp is agnostic relative to the piece, so it would be able to handle the mystery piece. (Kenneth checks and modifies)
5. Board Display: display the black and white square based on position value (odd or even). Display pieces using chess   
   symbols. Harmonize the given colors to produce this perfectly vivid board. It is highly recommended to use Dark mode to fully appreciate the aesthetics of the design.
